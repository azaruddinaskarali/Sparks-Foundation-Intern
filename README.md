Compilation of all the tasks I did during my tenure as an intern in Sparks Foundation


# Task-1 Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task I tried to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

This is a simple linear regression task involving just two variables.

# Task-7 Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

In this task I have created a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
